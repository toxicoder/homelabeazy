# Homelab as Code

This project uses Ansible to automate the setup of a homelab environment on a Proxmox server. It will provision a K3s cluster and deploy a set of core infrastructure and applications.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform v1.0+
- Ansible 2.10+
- Access to a Proxmox VE 7.x server
- A registered domain name (or a local DNS server)

## Deployment Workflow

This project uses a two-step process to deploy the homelab environment:

1.  **Provision Infrastructure:** Use Terraform to create the virtual machines for the K3s cluster on Proxmox.
2.  **Configure Cluster and Applications:** Use Ansible to configure the K3s cluster, install core infrastructure components, and deploy applications.

## Configuration

### Terraform

1.  **Navigate to the Terraform directory:**

    ```bash
    cd terraform
    ```

2.  **Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:**

    Copy the `terraform.tfvars.example` file to `terraform.tfvars` and edit it to match your environment.

    ```bash
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```

    | Variable              | Description                                                                 |
    | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `pm_api_url`          | The URL of your Proxmox API.                                                |
    | `pm_api_user`         | Your Proxmox API user.                                                      |
    | `pm_api_pass`         | Your Proxmox API password.                                                  |
    | `proxmox_host`        | The name of the Proxmox node to deploy to.                                  |
    | `template_name`       | The name of the cloud-init template to use.                                 |
    | `k3s_master_count`    | The number of K3s master nodes to create.                                   |
    | `k3s_worker_count`    | The number of K3s worker nodes to create.                                   |
    | `ssh_public_key`      | Your SSH public key for accessing the nodes.                                |

### Terraform Commands

-   **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

    This command initializes the Terraform working directory, downloading the necessary provider plugins.

-   **Plan the deployment:**

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

    This command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure.

-   **Apply the changes:**

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    This command applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.

-   **Destroy the infrastructure:**

    ```bash
    terraform destroy
    ```

    This command destroys all of the resources created by Terraform.

### Ansible

1.  **Configure Ansible variables:**

    Edit the `ansible/group_vars/all.yml` file to set your domain name, user passwords, and other application-specific configuration options.

2.  **Inventory (auto-generated):**

    The Ansible inventory is now automatically generated by Terraform. After you run `terraform apply`, a file named `inventory.auto.yml` will be created in the `ansible/inventory` directory. This file contains the IP addresses and other information about the nodes that were created.

## Usage

Once you have provisioned the infrastructure with Terraform and configured the Ansible variables, you can run the main playbook to set up your homelab:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/inventory.auto.yml ansible/playbooks/setup.yml
```

This will execute all the roles in the correct order to provision your homelab environment.
