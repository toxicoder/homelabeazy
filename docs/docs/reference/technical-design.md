# Technical Design Document

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Technical Design Document for Homelabeazy. This document provides a detailed technical overview of the project, from its high-level architecture down to the individual components. Whether you're a user who wants to understand the inner workings of your homelab, or a contributor who wants to help improve the project, this document will serve as your guide.

### Who is this for?

This document is intended for users who have a basic understanding of the core technologies used in this project, such as Proxmox, Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes. If you're new to these technologies, we recommend that you start with our [Getting Started guide]({% link docs/guides/getting-started.md %}) and then come back to this document for a deeper dive.

### Design Philosophy

The design of Homelabeazy is guided by a set of core principles that are common in modern DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices:

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** All infrastructure is defined as code, which allows for automation, versioning, and reproducibility.
*   **GitOps:** Git is the single source of truth for both infrastructure and applications. All changes are made through pull requests, which provides a clear audit trail and enables collaboration.
*   **Modularity:** The project is designed to be modular, so that you can easily add or remove components to suit your needs.
*   **Security by Design:** Security is a primary consideration in all aspects of the project, from network segmentation to secrets management.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1. Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

-   **Provide a complete blueprint for a modern homelab:** This project aims to be a comprehensive guide for building a powerful and flexible homelab environment.
-   **Automate everything:** From the provisioning of virtual machines to the deployment of applications, every aspect of the homelab should be automated.
-   **Ensure reproducibility:** You should be able to tear down and rebuild your entire homelab from scratch in a consistent and predictable manner.
-   **Promote best practices:** This project aims to demonstrate and encourage the use of enterprise-grade best practices for infrastructure management, such as IaC, GitOps, and security by design.
-   **Be highly customizable:** You should be able to easily customize the project to meet your specific needs, whether you want to add new applications, change the network configuration, or integrate with other systems.

### 2.2. Non-Goals

This project does not aim to:

-   **Be a one-size-fits-all solution:** While the project is highly customizable, it is not intended to be a universal solution for every homelab. It is designed for a specific set of technologies and use cases.
-   **Support other virtualization platforms:** The project is tightly coupled with Proxmox and does not support other hypervisors like ESXi or Hyper-V out of the box. However, the modular design of the project would allow for the addition of other providers in the future.
-   **Be a beginner-friendly project:** While we strive to make the documentation as clear as possible, a certain level of technical understanding of the core components (Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes) is expected.
-   **Be a production-ready enterprise solution:** While this project uses enterprise-grade practices, it is intended for personal homelab use and is not recommended for production enterprise workloads without significant additional hardening and testing.

### System Architecture Walkthrough

The system architecture is designed to be a robust, scalable, and automated homelab environment. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step walkthrough of the diagram, explaining the role and value of each component:

1.  **Hardware (Physical Server):**

    - **Component:** `Physical Server`
    - **Role:** This is the foundation of the entire homelab, providing the necessary compute, memory, and storage resources.
    - **Value:** A dedicated physical server ensures that all virtualized components have direct access to high-performance hardware, leading to better overall performance and stability.

2.  **Virtualization (Proxmox VE):**

    - **Component:** `Proxmox VE`
    - **Role:** Proxmox is an open-source virtualization platform that runs on the physical server. It allows for the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) and containers.
    - **Value:** Proxmox enables efficient hardware utilization by allowing multiple isolated environments to run on a single physical machine. This is crucial for creating a flexible and scalable infrastructure.

3.  **Automation (Terraform & Ansible):**

    - **Component:** `Terraform` & `Ansible`
    - **Role:**
        - `Terraform` is used to provision the virtual machines on Proxmox. It defines the infrastructure as code, making it easy to create, modify, and destroy VMs in a repeatable manner.
        - `Ansible` is used for configuration management. Once the VMs are provisioned, Ansible configures them and installs the necessary software like K3s.
    - **Value:** This combination of tools automates the entire setup process, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency. It allows you to rebuild the entire homelab from scratch with minimal intervention.

4.  **Container Orchestration & GitOps (K3s & ArgoCD):**

    - **Component:** `K3s Kubernetes Cluster` & `ArgoCD`
    - **Role:**
        - `K3s` is a lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution that runs on the VMs. It orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
        - `ArgoCD` provides a GitOps workflow. It continuously monitors a Git repository and automatically deploys any changes to the K3s cluster, ensuring that the cluster state always matches the state defined in Git.
    - **Value:** Kubernetes provides a powerful and standardized platform for running applications. ArgoCD automates application deployment and management, making it easy to track changes, roll back to previous versions, and maintain a consistent environment.

5.  **Applications (Core Services & User Applications):**

    - **Component:** `Core Services` & `User Applications`
    - **Role:** The K3s cluster runs two types of applications:
        - `Core Services`: These are essential infrastructure components like monitoring, logging, and security services.
        - `User Applications`: These are the end-user applications that you want to run in your homelab, such as a password manager, Git service, or home automation platform.
    - **Value:** This separation allows you to manage the core infrastructure independently of the applications, making it easier to update and maintain both.

6.  **Supporting Services (Traefik, Authelia, Vault):**

    - **Component:** `Traefik Ingress`, `Authelia SSO`, `Vault Secrets`
    - **Role:**
        - `Traefik Ingress`: A reverse proxy and load balancer that manages external access to the applications running in the cluster.
        - `Authelia SSO`: Provides single sign-on and two-factor authentication for the applications, enhancing security.
        - `Vault Secrets`: A secure storage for secrets like API keys, passwords, and certificates.
    - **Value:** These services provide essential functionality for managing and securing the applications. Traefik simplifies routing, Authelia centralizes authentication, and Vault protects sensitive information.

### General Flow of the System

1.  **Provisioning:** `Terraform` provisions the virtual machines on `Proxmox`.
2.  **Configuration:** `Ansible` configures the VMs and installs the `K3s Kubernetes Cluster`.
3.  **Deployment:** `ArgoCD` monitors the Git repository and deploys the `Core Services` and `User Applications` to the `K3s` cluster.
4.  **Access:**
    - Users access the applications through the `Traefik Ingress`.
    - `Authelia SSO` intercepts the requests to handle authentication.
5.  **Secrets Management:** The applications and the cluster use `Vault` to securely retrieve their secrets.

## 4. Detailed Component Design

### 4.1. Proxmox

-   **Why Proxmox?** Proxmox was chosen for its rich feature set, its open-source nature, and its excellent API support, which is crucial for automation.
-   **Prerequisites:** A working Proxmox installation is required.
-   **VM Templates:** The project relies on a cloud-init compatible VM template to be present on the Proxmox server. This template is used by Terraform to clone new VMs. The template should be a minimal installation of a supported OS (e.g., Ubuntu Server).

### 4.2. Terraform

-   **Why Terraform?** Terraform is a popular and powerful IaC tool that allows you to define your infrastructure in a declarative way. It has excellent support for Proxmox and a wide range of other providers.
-   **Configuration:** The main configuration file is `main.tf`, which defines the Proxmox provider and the VM resources.
-   **Variables:** User-specific variables, such as Proxmox API credentials and VM specifications (CPU, memory, disk), are defined in `variables.tf` and should be set in a `terraform.tfvars` file.

### 4.3. Ansible

-   **Why Ansible?** Ansible is a simple and powerful configuration management tool that is agentless, which means that you don't need to install any special software on the managed nodes.
-   **Inventory:** Ansible's inventory is located in `ansible/inventory/`. A static inventory file is provided for the user to fill in with the IP addresses of the newly created VMs.
-   **Playbooks and Roles:** The project uses a combination of playbooks and roles to organize the Ansible code. This modular structure allows for easy extension and customization.

### 4.4. K3s Cluster

-   **Why K3s?** K3s is designed to be a single binary that is easy to install, manage, and scale. It is a great choice for homelab environments where resources may be limited.
-   **Architecture:** The cluster consists of one or more master nodes and one or more worker nodes.
-   **Storage:** The project is configured to use the default K3s storage provisioner (local-path-provisioner), which is suitable for single-node clusters or development environments. For multi-node clusters, a more robust storage solution like Longhorn or an NFS provisioner would be recommended.

### 4.5. ArgoCD

-   **Why ArgoCD?** ArgoCD is a popular and powerful GitOps tool that provides a clear and intuitive way to manage your applications.
-   **App of Apps Pattern:** The project uses the "app of apps" pattern, which allows for modular management of applications.

### 4.6. Networking

The project uses a VLAN-based network segmentation strategy to isolate traffic and enhance security.

-   **Traefik:** Traefik is a modern reverse proxy and load balancer that is used as the Ingress controller for the K3s cluster.
-   **Consul:** Consul is used for service discovery within the cluster.
-   **pfSense:** pfSense is a powerful open-source firewall and router that is used to manage the network.

### 4.7. Security

-   **Vault:** HashiCorp Vault is used for secrets management.
-   **Authelia:** Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO).
-   **OpenLDAP:** OpenLDAP is used as the central user directory.

### 4.8. Monitoring and Logging

-   **EFK Stack:** The project uses the EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana) for centralized logging.

### 4.9. Backup and Recovery

-   **Velero:** Velero is used for backing up and restoring the Kubernetes cluster.
